	Memory forms an integral component of every computing systems. These are the parts of the computer that are used for storage and retrival of code and data that are essential for operation of computers. It is these retrival of code and data the makes these computers or computing systems perform all the tasks that we, the user, instruct them to do.

	When the term "memory" is used, it generally means the Random Access Memory (RAM) or the memory where the instructions for current (and maybe more) operations are stored. But, this is just a small part of memory system in a computer system. Now a reader might be wondering where the bulk files, multimedia, etc are stored. There is another memory, which is more generally called "storage". It is in this storage system that all bulk files are stored. In the conventional workstation computer settings, Magnetic Disks form the storage system. Nowadays, Solid State Drives (SSDs) are getting traction as well for storage purposes.

<p>
	In the conventional computer settings, memory or RAM is composed of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM). These memory loose their content when the power is removed, thus they form "Volatile Memory". Another example of volatile memory is SRAM, which is extensively used in caches in conventional PC settings while in embedded systems SRAM is used to serve as RAM.

<p>
	Magnetic Disks and Optical Disks are some of the non-volatile memory as they do not remove their content when the power is turned off. These devices store the content as physical change in them, and this physical change do not depend on the power being supplied. However for SRAM and DRAM, they need to be supplied with power in order for them to function or retain their content.

<p>
	Both the kinds of non-volatile memory (NVM) presented above, namely, Magnetic and Optical Disks are not semiconductor based. Thus, when people talk about NVM, these two are kind of left out. We will present a short description of these in the below section, however, they will not be major focus.

<p>
	Semiconductor NVMs are based on the similar principle as Magnetic and Optical Disks in the sense that the content or the data to be stored in them are etched as a change in their physical property and they do not need a constant supply of power to hold the power. Flash Memory are currently the major semiconductor right now, and it has still not realized its full market potential. As metioned above, flash memories are used for storage purpose in newer computing systems as SSD drives while they have found their majoirty usage in portable storage media. In low-end computing systems, a special kind flash memory is even used for RAM memories. We will see about different kinds of flash memories in later sections.

	Each of these have their separate sections below. Please find the approprite section and study the further descriptions presented. On each of the topics, will present a brief introduction and some relevant papers and their discussion.
