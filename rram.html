			Resistive RAM or ReRAM works in the fashion similar to PCM <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistive_random-access_memory">(ref)</a>, i.e. by changing the resistance of the dielectric solid-state meterial. Here a metal oxide is sandwiched between two metal electrodes <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2463209.2488867">(ref)</a>. RRAM works by creating defects in the oxide layer to create a filmaent or a condictive path by the application of high voltage.

			The filament can be broken resulting in a high resistance state and can be formed to result in a low resistance state.
